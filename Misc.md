न चोरहार्यं न च राजहार्यं न भ्रातॄभाज्यं न च भारकारि |   
व्यये कॄते वर्धत एव नित्यं विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानं ||   
It cannot be stolen by thieves, nor can it be taken away by kings. It need not be divided among brothers and it does not cause a load on your shoulders. If spent, it indeed always keeps growing. The wealth of knowledge is the most superior wealth of all!

***

सत्यं ब्रुयात् प्रियम् ब्रुयान्नब्रुयात् सत्यमप्रियम् |   
प्रियम् च नानॄतम् ब्रुयादेष: धर्म: सनातन: ||   
Speak truth. Speak what is pleasant to others. Don't speak truth that is unpleasant ("harmful"). Even if pleasant, don't speak what is false. This is Dharma for all time.

एकं शास्त्रमधीयानो न गच्छेच्छास्त्रनिर्णयम् |   
If you know/study only one subject, you cannot go around saying anything authoritatively even in that subject!

आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते From guru, 1/4th

उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत,   
क्षुरासन्न धारा निशिता दुरत्यद्दुर्गम पथ: तत् कवयो वदन्ति |   
Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn.   
Like the sharp edge of a razor is that path,   
so the wise say−hard to tread and difficult to cross.
