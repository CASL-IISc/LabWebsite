Do not modify the html files directly.   
Use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)  

Download the source for CASL site from [github.com/arpith20](https://github.com/arpith20/IISc_CASL) 

To edit, modify or add publications and student information, look at _data directory.   
<hr> 
Again, do NOT modify html files from the server directly. Modify the [jekyll site source](https://github.com/arpith20/IISc_CASL), build the site and then upload the contents of _site to the server.
